Shall we start from beginning.

## Apresentation 

I’m currently 20 years old and graduating in Computer Engineering. By this point, I’ve been 
introduced to the essentials of the field (I think so), but that’s not all there is to it.

Computers are a vast universe, and their intricate depths submerge into entirely different 
worlds. My eyes sparkle a little when I think abstractly about it—the philosophy behind such 
a broad subject. In fact, calling it a mere "topic" feels almost disrespectful, given how 
immense and diverse it truly is.

Some people (mostly adults) ask me, “So, what’s your area of interest?” As a human being, 
I’m tempted to reply, “It’s like asking me to choose just one area of Mathematics—Algebra, 
Geometry, Calculus 1, 2, or 3. Please, take it easy!” Don’t misunderstand me—it’s wonderful 
to explore broadly. But choosing only one thing? That’s the challenge.

As a child, I changed my mind every time someone asked what I wanted to be when I grew up. 
I considered becoming a doctor, firefighter, police officer, astronaut, teacher, musician, 
singer, rapper, artist, and countless other things. So for me, indecision is familiar.

The same goes for this blog. I debated whether to post on LinkedIn, Instagram, or GitHub 
itself. But I’ve always admired people who carve out their own space on the internet—like 
leaving a piece of their mind out there to be read and be judged, if others choose to.

Let me be clear: I’m not here to influence anyone. You’re reading this of your own free 
will (which, honestly, I don’t highly recommend). I’m no an expert, but if you’d like to 
join me on this learning adventure, you’re welcome!

I’d like to create some way for us to communicate inside the blog (as soon as it is possible
I'll do it), should anyone want to leave suggestions. And remember: just as you have the 
free will to dislike what I write, I reserve the same right to ignore it.

Have a good day!
